# AI-First Design: MCP and Agentic Workflows

Cyclonetix is designed to be AI-first from the ground up, integrating intelligent agents directly into the workflow orchestration engine. This document outlines the architecture and features for MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration and agentic workflow capabilities.

## Core Concepts

### Agentic Tasks

Tasks in Cyclonetix can be either traditional (shell commands) or agentic (MCP calls). Agentic tasks leverage AI agents to make intelligent decisions, analyze data, and dynamically modify workflow execution.

### Evaluation Points with Intelligence

Evaluation points serve as decision nodes where AI agents can:

- Analyze workflow state and data
- Make intelligent routing decisions
- Determine appropriate next steps based on context
- Modify execution graphs dynamically

### High-Speed + Intelligent Flows

Cyclonetix combines high-speed stream processing (millions of events/second) with intelligent reasoning where it matters:

- **Fast path**: Traditional stream processing for routine operations
- **Smart path**: Agentic analysis for edge cases, exceptions, and complex decisions
- **Human approval gates**: Critical decisions requiring human oversight

## MCP Integration Architecture

### Agent Runtime

- MCP server runs as sidecar to orchestrator
- Agent pool for concurrent task processing
- Task routing between traditional and agentic execution paths
- Context preservation across agent interactions

### Task Types

#### Traditional Tasks

```yaml
id: "process_data"
name: "Process Daily Data"
command: "python process_data.py --input ${INPUT_FILE}"
type: "traditional"
```

#### Agentic Tasks

```yaml
id: "analyze_patterns"
name: "Analyze Data Patterns"
command: "mcp://pattern-analyzer"
type: "agentic"
context:
  - data_history
  - system_conditions
  - business_rules
evaluation_point: true
```

### Agent Evaluation Points

Agents can dynamically modify workflow execution by:

- Adding new tasks based on analysis results
- Modifying parameters for downstream tasks
- Branching workflows based on intelligent decisions
- Updating context for subsequent operations

## Use Case Examples

### Intelligent Data Processing

```yaml
workflow: "data_processing"
description: "AI-powered data processing with dynamic response"
tasks:
  - id: "ingest_data"
    type: "traditional"
    command: "kafka-consumer --topic data-stream"
    
  - id: "analyze_patterns"
    type: "agentic" 
    command: "mcp://pattern-analyzer"
    dependencies: ["ingest_data"]
    evaluation_point: true
    context:
      - data_history
      - system_metrics
      - business_rules
    
  - id: "generate_insights"
    type: "conditional"  # Created dynamically by agent
    command: "python generate_insights.py --severity ${SEVERITY}"
```

### Compliance Automation

```yaml
workflow: "compliance_monitoring"
description: "Automated compliance monitoring and reporting"
tasks:
  - id: "collect_data"
    type: "traditional"
    command: "extract_data.py --date ${DATE}"
    
  - id: "compliance_check"
    type: "agentic"
    command: "mcp://compliance-analyzer"
    dependencies: ["collect_data"]
    evaluation_point: true
    context:
      - regulation_text
      - historical_cases
      - company_policies
    
  - id: "risk_assessment"
    type: "agentic"
    command: "mcp://risk-evaluator"
    dependencies: ["compliance_check"]
    context:
      - compliance_results
      - entity_profile
      - transaction_history
```

### Dynamic Exception Handling

Agents can intelligently route exceptions based on:

- **Severity analysis**: Determine if manual review is required
- **Historical patterns**: Learn from previous resolutions
- **Context awareness**: Consider system conditions, entity risk profiles
- **Escalation logic**: Automatically involve appropriate teams

## Technical Implementation

### Event-Driven Architecture

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub enum CyclonetixEvent {
    // Traditional events
    TaskCompleted { task_id: String, result: TaskResult },
    
    // Agentic events
    AgentAnalysisRequested { task_id: String, context: AgentContext },
    AgentDecisionMade { task_id: String, decision: AgentDecision },
    WorkflowModified { run_id: String, modifications: Vec<GraphModification> },
}
```

### MCP Integration Layer

```rust
pub struct MCPIntegration {
    server_pool: MCPServerPool,
    context_manager: ContextManager,
    decision_engine: DecisionEngine,
}

impl MCPIntegration {
    pub async fn execute_agentic_task(
        &self, 
        task: &AgenticTask,
        context: &WorkflowContext
    ) -> Result<AgentDecision, MCPError> {
        // Execute MCP call with context
        // Parse agent response
        // Return decision with graph modifications
    }
}
```

### Agent Decision Format

```json
{
  "decision": "route_for_review",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Unusual pattern detected in data processing pipeline",
  "next_tasks": ["escalate_to_team", "generate_detailed_report"],
  "parameters": {
    "escalate_to_team": {
      "priority": "high",
      "reviewer": "senior_analyst"
    }
  },
  "context_updates": {
    "risk_level": "elevated",
    "requires_review": true
  },
  "metadata": {
    "analysis_time_ms": 250,
    "data_sources": ["historical_data", "system_metrics", "entity_profile"]
  }
}
```

## Design Principles

- **Intelligence where it matters**: Use AI for complex decisions, traditional processing for routine operations
- **Audit everything**: Full traceability for regulatory compliance
- **Human oversight**: Always maintain human control and override capabilities
- **Performance first**: AI enhancement should not compromise core orchestration speed
- **Context awareness**: Agents should understand business context, not just technical data
- **Fail safely**: Graceful degradation when AI services are unavailable

This AI-first design positions Cyclonetix as the next generation of workflow orchestration, combining the speed of traditional processing with the intelligence of modern AI agents.
